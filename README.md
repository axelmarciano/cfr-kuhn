# Kuhn Poker + CFR üé≤

I built this little project to learn how **Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR)** works in practice.  
Instead of going straight into huge poker solvers, I wanted to start small with **Kuhn Poker**, which is a super tiny poker game that still has bluffing, betting, and strategy.

## What‚Äôs Kuhn Poker? üÉè
- 2 players
- Deck of 3 cards: Jack, Queen, King
- Each player antes 1 chip
- Each gets 1 private card (the 3rd card is hidden)
- Simple betting round:
  - First player can check or bet 1 chip
  - If first player checks, the second can check (go to showdown) or bet
  - If a bet happens, the other can call or fold
- Showdown: higher card wins the pot

## What‚Äôs CFR? ü§ñ
CFR = **Counterfactual Regret Minimization**.  
It‚Äôs an algorithm that:
- Keeps track of how much you ‚Äúregret‚Äù not taking certain actions
- Increases the chances of actions that had positive regret
- Decreases the chances of actions with negative regret
- Over many iterations, the average strategy converges towards a **Nash equilibrium**

## Results after 5M iterations üìä
*(The overall regret did not reach the 1e-4 threshold.)*

### Player 1 (P1)

| InfoSet   | Action probabilities       | Note |
|-----------|----------------------------|------|
| Q         | check **100%**, bet 0%     | Q never bets at equilibrium |
| J         | bet ~22%, check ~78%       | Bluffs ~22% with J (‚â§ 1/3, consistent) |
| K         | bet ~66%, check ~34%       | Value-bets ~66% (‚âà 3 √ó bluff freq) |
| Q \| cb   | call ~55%, fold ~45%       | Calls with Q ~Œ±+1/3 (here 0.22+0.33 ‚âà 0.55) |
| J \| cb   | fold **100%**              | J always folds vs bet (can‚Äôt win) |
| K \| cb   | call **100%**              | K always calls (best hand) |

### Player 2 (P2)

| InfoSet   | Action probabilities       | Note |
|-----------|----------------------------|------|
| J \| c    | bet ~33%, check ~67%       | Semi-bluff with J 1/3 of the time |
| J \| b    | fold **100%**              | J folds if raised |
| Q \| c    | check **100%**             | Q checks, never bets itself |
| Q \| b    | call ~33%, fold ~67%       | Defends vs bluff by calling 1/3 |
| K \| c    | bet **100%**               | K always value-bets |
| K \| b    | call **100%**              | K always calls vs bet |

---

### üßê Interpretation
- **Bluff/value balance:** P1 bluffs ~22% with J and value-bets ~66% with K ‚Üí ratio matches theory.
- **Defense:** P2 calls with Q only 1/3 of the time, which prevents P1 from bluffing too much.
- **Consistency:** Every deviation (e.g. J folding always, K betting/calling always) matches the known Nash equilibrium of Kuhn Poker.
